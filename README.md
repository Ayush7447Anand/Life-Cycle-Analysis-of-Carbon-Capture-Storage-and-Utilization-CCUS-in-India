# Life-Cycle-Analysis-of-Carbon-Capture-Storage-and-Utilization-CCUS-in-India
Conducted a comprehensive life cycle analysis of carbon capture, storage, and utilization (CCUS) for an India coal-fired thermal power plant, assessing environmental impacts and greenhouse gas emission reductions.
Developed models to compare the environmental performance of power plants with and without CCUS, incorporating data on emissions, energy consumption, and resource utilization.
Synthesized results to provide insights for sustainable energy strategies and policy recommendations, supporting India's climate change mitigation goals.
